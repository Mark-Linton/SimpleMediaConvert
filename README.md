# Simple Media Convert
A basic tool that at present joins split media files into a single file without modifying codec/containers. 

The tool was created primarily because Emby lacks full support for split files. As such only files that have names that contain part 1, part 2 etc will appear in the source pane.

## Future Features
* Enable media codec/container conversion. From WMV to MKV or MP4 for example. 
* Enable sorting of selected media files.
* Improve displayed items to include more information than just the filename.
